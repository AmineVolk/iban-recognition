Iban-recognition allows you to extract an iban from any text and it also gives you more informations such as:

- The country where the iban belongs
- The iban's validity.

Example :

```js
const testToExtractIbans =
  "DE91100000000123456789qsf aaDK60-0040-0440-2262-44qsfqsd BE71 0961 2345 6769 ";
const ibans = getIbans(testToExtractIbans);

// The result :
[
  {
    iban: "DE91100000000123456789",
    country: "Germany",
    isIbanValid: true
  },
  {
    iban: "DK60-0040-0440-2262-44",
    country: "Denmark",
    isIbanValid: false
  },
  {
    iban: "BE71 0961 2345 6769",
    country: "Belgium",
    isIbanValid: true
  }
];
```

## To improve

An IBAN can be defined differently from one country to another, most of them can be distinguish by their length, that's why each country should have a different regex, I tried to gather as much countries as I could, but as you know there's a lot of them so..you can guess the rest.

You can check if your country is supported as follow:

```js
const isCountryTaken = isCountrySupported("France");
// result : True
```

And if you want to help, you can add your country by following these steps:

- Add the country to the file countries.js
- Add the regex to recognize it in regex.js
- Run all the tests to avoid a regression
- And finally do a PR

## Supported countries

If you want to have the list of supported countries, you should do as follow:

```js
const countries = getCountries();
```
